# Reports

The reports inbox allows you to view reports created by users. This inbox essentially acts the same as the regular user notification tab.

Each report contains a title which will specify the type of the report and the target asset. The title will likely contain a link to view the asset.

The body of each report will contain the exact text given by the user, as well as the IP of the user who created the report. As with every IP (besides the IPs in the audit log and moderator panel), clicking the IP will prompt you to either ban the IP or view the first profile associated with the IP.

You can press the "Open" button on a report to open the target asset, or the "Delete" button to remove the report. The "Delete" button also acts as a "Mark as resolved" button.
