# Warnings tab

Finally, we have the warnings tab. This tab allows you to create a manage the warnings left by other moderators on the user's profile. When a warning is created, the user will receive a notification telling them about it. The notification _doesn't_ include the username of the moderator who created the warning.

## What makes a good warning?

A good warning is actually quite simple. While warnings _are_ a punishment, they're also a way of taking mercy on users who have broken the rules.

A good warning is easy: don't be mean, get quick and concise, and **always cite the TOS!** Citing the TOS is the most important step, because otherwise questions could be raised about _why_ the warning was ever created in the first place.
