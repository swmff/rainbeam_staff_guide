# Info tab

The "Info" (information) tab contains basic information about the user:

- Join date
- Group number
    - The user's group number can be changed by clicking on the number. This number can be set to `-1` to mark the user as banned. Attempting to change it to a number which isn't bound to a group will result in an error.
- Tier number
    - The user's tier number can be changed by clicking on the number.
- Coin amount
    - Coins can be **added** (use a negative to subtract) from the user's balance by clicking on the number.
- Verify URL + verify code
    - The user's verify URL can be changed by clicking on the URL.

The tab also includes various links to view the user's private pages:

- View mail
- View items
- View settings
- View notifications

Each of those links will open their respective pages as the user in question. For example, changing the settings after you click on "View settings" will change the settings of the user, not of yourself.

You can also view every setting the user has set (with its true identifier) on this page.
