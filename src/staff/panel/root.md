# Mod panel

Every moderator ([`Helper` and higher](../roles.md)) can access the "Manage (Mod)" tab on every profile. This tab shows various pieces of information which may help you moderate slightly more efficiently.

The panel has a few sub-tabs:

- [Info](./info.md)
- [Badges](./badges.md)
- [Password](./password.md)
- [Sessions](./sessions.md)
- [Chats](./chats.md)
- [Warnings](./warnings.md)
