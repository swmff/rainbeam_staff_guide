# Sessions tab

The sessions tab is one of the most powerful moderator tabs available to staff. Through this tab, you can view the **same sessions table available in user settings**. On top of this, you can click "New" to create a custom session with a custom identifier and permissions.

You can delete the user's sessions at will, as well as see the IP address, app, creation date, and permissions of each session.

The session token is returned after creating a new session, allowing you to directly sign in by updating your `__Secure-Token` cookie to this unique token.
